# Garden Planner #

## Targets of the project ##
- User login and account management
- Add plants and gardening areas to the system by user
- Provide month by month planning for planning harvesting and moving plants
    - For example, tomatoes on the window for Feburary move to the rised planter 1 in March.
- Give the user notifications to when actions are required
    - Start off with email notifications
    - Add push notification later down the line
- Implement with weather API to let the user know if it is going to rain today, to save the user from watering the plants
    - Will need to let the user define whether a gardening area is indoors or outdoors
